# Linux Router with Wi-Fi Uplink

This repository is a documentation-based infrastructure case study.

It describes a real-world setup where a Linux server is used as a router:
- Internet uplink via Wi-Fi (USB adapter)
- LAN distribution via Ethernet
- DHCP and DNS handled by Pi-hole
- Configuration survives reboot

No automation scripts are included by design.
