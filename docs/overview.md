# Overview

This setup was created to explore how Linux behaves as a router
when the internet uplink is provided via Wi-Fi instead of Ethernet.

Such configurations are common in:
- homelabs
- temporary setups
- edge routing scenarios
- VPN gateways

The goal was not performance, but correctness and predictability.

This setup was built and tested on a personal homelab server.
Several iterations were required before achieving a stable and
predictable configuration.
